# Advent of Code 2023 Solution Elixir

I'm doing AOC to practice Elixir. The code might not be the most optimized or orderly.

# Instructions

I made these on `iex` running in a Docker Image, then copied over. Might not run perfectly when pulled.

## Versions

Erlang version `Erlang/OTP 26 [erts-14.2] [source] [64-bit] [smp:8:8] [ds:8:8:10] [async-threads:1] [jit:ns]`

IEx version `Interactive Elixir (1.15.7)`

## Structure

One module for each day. Named `Aoc.DayN`.

Every module has two functions: `first_part` and `second_part`. Both take the puzzle input as string(with linebreak). Output not specified.
